Broadly speaking, I study sources of variability and change in Northern Hemisphere winter weather from a climatological or pattern-finding perspective. I am interested in the ways that conditions upwind and local forcings work together to transform air masses as they are transported across the globe and generate extreme weather. Processes connecting mid-latitude weather to changes in other regions, especially the Arctic, are a particular focus of mine. I also have a passion for clouds that hasn't quite turned into a research project yet, but give me time. I'll get there.
