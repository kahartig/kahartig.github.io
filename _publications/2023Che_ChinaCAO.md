title: "Understanding the physical processes in the evolution of a cold air outbreak over China in late November 2022 from a Lagrangian perspective"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_2023_Che.html
excerpt: 'A nationwide cold air outbreak hit China from 26 November to 1 December 2022. This study uses the evolution of dry static energy along air parcel trajectories to investigate the variation in cooling sources across the regions impacted by this cold air event. Longwave radiative cooling is the largest contributor to the temperature evolution in all regions, with latent heat processes as a secondary effect. Central Siberia and Lake Baikal are identified as key areas where particularly intense cooling of air parcels occurred.'
