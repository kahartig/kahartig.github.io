title: "Time-dependent density-functional-theory investigation of the collisions of protons and &alpha; particles with uracil and adenine"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017_paper_Covington
excerpt: 'Advanced simulation techniques in quantum mechanics have made it possible to understand the effects of high-energy radiation on the molecules that form the basis of key biological functions in great detail. This paper leverages these techniques to understand how high-energy protons and &alpha; particles, commonly used in modern radiation therapy, exchange energy and electrons with uracil and adenine, two of the four RNA base molecules.'

Advanced simulation techniques in quantum mechanics have made it possible to understand the effects of high-energy radiation on the molecules that form the basis of key biological functions in great detail. This paper leverages these techniques to understand how high-energy protons and &alpha; particles, commonly used in modern radiation therapy, exchange energy and electrons with uracil and adenine, two of the four RNA base molecules.
