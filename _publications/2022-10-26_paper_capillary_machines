Industrial techniques for braiding and weaving fibers struggle to handle micrometer-scale filaments without snapping them. We introduce a novel approach to manipulating filaments on this scale, using centimeter-scale 3D printed devices that take advantage of a repulsive capillary force to gently trap and steer floats and filaments to produce braids of varying complexity.
