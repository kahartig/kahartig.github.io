Advanced simulation techniques in quantum mechanics have made it possible to understand the effects of high-energy radiation on the molecules that form the basis of key biological functions in great detail. This paper leverages these techniques to understand how high-energy protons and alpha particles, commonly used in modern radiation therapy, exchange energy and electrons with uracil and adenine, two of the four RNA base molecules.
