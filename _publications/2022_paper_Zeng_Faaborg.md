title: "3D-printed machines that manipulate microscopic objects using capillary forces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022_paper_Zeng_Faaborg
excerpt: 'Industrial techniques for braiding and weaving fibers struggle to handle micrometer-scale filaments without snapping them. We introduce a novel approach to manipulating filaments on this scale, using centimeter-scale 3D printed devices that take advantage of a repulsive capillary force to gently trap and steer floats and filaments to produce braids of varying complexity.'

Industrial techniques for braiding and weaving fibers struggle to handle micrometer-scale filaments without snapping them. We introduce a novel approach to manipulating filaments on this scale, using centimeter-scale 3D printed devices that take advantage of a repulsive capillary force to gently trap and steer floats and filaments to produce braids of varying complexity.
