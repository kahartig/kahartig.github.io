In the spring term of 2020 and 2021, I served as a teaching fellow for the undergraduate class EPS 101: Global Warming Science. Through a combination of lectures, python coding assignments, and policy memos, students were introduced to the scientific principles underpinning global warming as well as the changes predicted to occur over the next century. Each week, we covered a new topic, ranging from the greenhouse effect to sea level rise, drought, and hurricanes.
